  summary: |
    Hi there! Your presence here means a lot to me, and I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to connect. Let me give you a glimpse into who I am.
    
    I’m Mauricio Gastón Pineda, a Full Stack Developer from Tigre, Buenos Aires, Argentina. But more than that, I’m someone who fell in love with programming at an early age. At around 8 years old, I started tinkering with LOGO—the one with the turtle—and would spend hours building creations with Legos, imagining endless possibilities. That passion never left me; it only grew stronger.
    
    Over the years, this fascination shaped my career. I embraced a love for elegant software design and best practices, starting with PHP, exploring Zend Framework, and immersing myself in the Magento E-commerce Platform. I’ve been privileged to lead challenging projects, from migrating monolithic architectures to microservices to enhancing security, performance, and scalability for e-commerce businesses.
    
    Beyond my deep expertise in Magento, PHP, Flutter, Ruby, and microservices, I’ve also worked on building custom frameworks and APIs, always driven by a desire to solve complex problems with simplicity and efficiency. My ability to adapt to new technologies and languages has allowed me to collaborate successfully with diverse teams in startups and large corporations.
    
    But what truly defines me is my belief in the power of thoughtful details. Whether it’s crafting a secure e-commerce platform or developing a dynamic app, I approach each project with discipline, curiosity, and an eye for innovation.
